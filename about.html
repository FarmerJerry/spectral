		<h2>About Farm 6 Media</h2>
					<p>Farm 6 Media helps businesses, artists, and individuals achieve online success through our graphic design, copywriting, a/v, and web development services.</p>
				</header>
				<p>We were founded in 2016 by Jeremy Shantz, who had recently graduated from Sheridan College for Web Development.  With decades of experience in computer programming, Jeremy is no stranger to code.  Web Development was a natural step towards his motivation to use code and art together to make wonderful website experiences.</p>
				<p>Here at the Farm (not really a farm, but we like to think of ourselves as gardeners of the web, growing content and experiences), we strive to make every project fantastic.  The way we approach our clients requests is the same way we approach our own projects.  There is always an attempt to put ourselves into the shoes of the client.  What would we want to see as an end result?  That's how we look at every piece of content we work on, treat it like it's our own.</p>

				<h3>More About Our Fearless Leader</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="A photo of Jeremy Shantz, aka Farmer Jer." /></span>Jeremy has a passion for three things: speed, code, and art.  He loves to get down and dirty with the programming side of websites.  So, it's not surprising that he went to school for web development.  He also loves speed.  Anyone who knows the car he drives will attest to that.  Rally racing is an interest of his, so it makes sense that speed of a website is one of his top priorities.</p>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>And last we have his love of art.  Jeremy has worked professionally in the music and television industries.  As a trained-through-experience audio engineer and musician, Jeremy loves nothing more than to site down in the studio and create something for the ears to enjoy.  And it doesn't stop there.  Experienced with voice-overs, engineering and with years of live performance as a vocalist experience, Jeremy knows as much about audio as he does code and development.</p>
				<p>Working with his companies he has owned over the years (including a mechanical assembly/repair company, a petshop, and a paintball store), Jeremy has always done his own graphics work.  From creating album covers to making logos, he has over 20 years experience working with a variety of graphics software and can make images come to life for your website.  Whether it's a website layout design, an album cover, or an infographic, you can trust Jeremy to create you something beautiful.</p>
