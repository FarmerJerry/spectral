<h2><strong>Entrepreneur Series</strong></h2>
<p>Any Entrepreneur will tell you, starting a business is not an easy road. It takes hours and hours of work, dedication and sometimes, at least in the case of internet bloggers for example, it may not pay until well down the road. This can make some of the small decisions seem like they are rather trivial, but understanding a few important principles before you begin and a few tricks, can really save you a lot of agony down the road. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are first making a business, usually the process begins with an idea. Let’s use a small business I ran for many years as our example. The business I ran was an assembly and repair company. I had multiple technicians working for me who would go to stores that I had contracts with and assemble and repair items in the stores. Usually, this meant bicycles, but we also working on barbecues, lawn mowers, patio furniture and so on. Anyway, when I started the business, I was already doing that sort of work and thought, no problem I can do this on my own. I marched down to the government office and paid for a business license and away I went. Now at the time, I knew NOTHING about marketing or graphic design, but I had a great idea I was already making money at. </p>
<p>So I put the first thing I thought of as a reasonable name down on the business license. I worked for a few weeks with the handy generic receipt book I purchased and was starting to get tired of writing out my business name and address all the time so I decided I would get some invoices printed. Remember when I said I had no idea what I was doing with design? Anyway, I got the invoices and work orders printed at a local shop, cost a few hundred dollars, and they looked horrid. Now at the time, I don’t think I had chosen any kind of font, or colors, or even had a logo so my paperwork was horribly boring to look at and I was writing my name down on note paper because I had no business cards. So off I went, back to the printer, paid my $100 and got a bunch of business cards. </p>
<p>All generic font, all terribly boring. Later in the fall, as business slowed for the bicycle work, I went out and handed out business cards trying to drum up some more work and I got a lot of comments from people about how bland my business card was. I remember one person even commenting that it was good he talked to me in person because the business card was already forgotten it was so generic. I felt like a fool, let me tell you. </p>
<p>So now that we have a virtual business card called websites, and no one cares about actual printed paper anymore, the design is more important than ever. You want your business to stand out. A website is a digital extension of your company’s virtual self (to get all Matrix-like about it). You don’t want your company to be bland, you want it to stand out. That’s why I’ve got this basic starter list put together of the 4 things you need to start your company’s visual presence.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Quite the Character</strong></h2>
<p>What the heck does he mean by Character? That’s what you’re probably thinking. I find a great way to extend the concept of branding your company image is to imagine your company as a character. How do you want this character to act and be treated out in the world? I find if you personify your company, it makes branding and thus marketing the business much, much easier. Maybe it was my days working in the entertainment industry that taught me that, but I’ve seen it work a hundred times and it works great. Let’s review the marketing tactics of Geico in the USA, they use a cartoon gecko as their mascot and it’s a memorable character. Having a mascot works great but maybe that’s not your company’s ‘thing’, but if you examine how you want the ‘feel’ of your company to be when it comes to appearance, it can really make a huge difference. </p>
<p>Another great example of this is McDonald’s. Now you won’t catch me eating there, but you have to admit the marketing is brilliant. Bright, playful colors and a clown in the same colors as the mascot. Is it any wonder McDonald’s got the attention of every kid? And the toys they throw into the happy meal, very effective marketing. Add in that they offer a service that is needed – fast food for those too busy to have time to cook. Not to get too far afield here, let’s get back to the character of the company and what it means. When I have a client, I always want to know what the feeling is like. Whether it’s the logo, the font, or even a letterhead, the visual design should portray the feel of the character of the company. </p>
<h2><strong>2. Official Colors of [your business name here]!</strong></h2>
<p>Color is the backbone of any beautiful painting, well most of the time. Okay, okay, black and white photography is pretty cool looking, but seriously, not many companies choose black and white as their official colors so let’s carry on, shall we? Okay, so it’s important to note about color that we don’t want any colors that clash is a bad way, correct? There’s a really cool and FREE site I use all the time when I’ve got a design dilemma when it comes to choosing a color: <a href='http://paletton.com' target='_blank' class='url'>http://paletton.com</a> By the way, this is NOT an affiliate link. I make zero from referring you, it’s just a great tool! I recommend to my clients that they pick a color scheme that is either 3 or 4 basic colors and that we use the tool to find colors that are mathematically complementary.</p>

<h2><strong>3. What the Font?</strong></h2>

<p>Choosing font is easy, once you’ve established the character of the company. There are a few things to remember about font though. First off, you can choose either a standard, web-friendly font or you can go the other way and get a totally unique font. I find if the nature of your business is a serious one like you run a health care clinic, or perhaps you work as a business consultant, then you want a font that portrays dignified, trustworthy, authoritative virtues. Whereas if you are a rock band producer or a tattoo parlor owner, you may want a font that’s kind of edgy and stands out. Or you might be starting a car tuning business focusing on imported models, or you might work in I.T. so you want your font to show a speedy or futuristic flair to it. Font says a lot subconsciously about the nature of your business. </p>
<p>I owned a pet shop at one time and for that business, I chose a playful almost child-like font. I did this because most of my clients were parents getting their child a pet or pet supplies and typically brought their children with them into my store, so the kids really were a good indication that they liked my branding. But beware of a few things when it comes to font. First, depending on the nature of your business, you may need to get permission to use the font commercially. This is typically only the case when it comes to reselling the font, but it’s a good idea to cover your legal butt. Secondly, you can typically use standard web fonts without worrying about getting sued, but these are usually bland looking and, in my opinion, boring. </p>
<p>Using a custom or non-standard font can really change the look and feel of your website and/or business printed material but there’s always a catch to looking good. The catch is that if you’re talking websites, you need to pre-load your font to give the viewer the ability to see the words the way you intend. There are more likely chances of the site screwing up on different devices as well. And depending on what type of operating system and version of the browser the viewer is using on their device the font may not work at all. Most web developers who are building sites with non-standard font will, of course, make code allowances for this sort of situation but if you are a do-it-yourselfer then you should really keep this font issue in mind. </p>
<p>So you’re probably wondering where you would get a cool font that you won’t get sued for using. Again, not an affiliate link, I like to scope out <a href='https://www.fontsquirrel.com' target='_blank' class='url'>https://www.fontsquirrel.com</a> for fonts. They have a bunch that will redirect you to go pay someone for them, but they also have a whack of free to use fonts. The smaller font publishers can be contacted too which is what I did with a paintball business I had several years ago – I found a really cool font that came with the generic free to use license and I went to the effort of sending the font creator an email to confirm my use of the font. He sent me written permission to use it as I please and I’ve used the font since. This way you’re not likely to get in trouble for using someone’s font. </p>
<h2><strong>4. Logo Time!</strong></h2>
<p>Where is MC Hammer when you need him… Seriously though, now that you have the character of the business, the colors and the font, it’s time for the logo. Bringing these 3 things to a graphic designer and you will be their new favorite client. Believe me, it will make their job a lot easier, but more importantly, your logo will SUIT your business 100x more than it would have if you didn’t have these sorted out already. </p>
<p>Naturally, I offer logo design services and if you read this article, then get those 3 items together, send me an email or contact form on this site with your character, colors, and font, and I’ll design the first 5 that I receive for FREE. After that, I’ll give a whopping discount to anyone else who wants a logo as long as you tell me the secret phrase ‘Super Squirrel’ (basically just a test to see if you read the whole article tee hee) I like to reward people for being perceptive, what can I say. Anyway, I really don’t have any advice for designing your own logo except to consider where it will be displayed and keep the 3 first items in mind and voila! Presto blamo, there’s a logo! </p>
