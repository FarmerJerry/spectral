<p>When we’re choosing a domain name for our website, we want to consider seven different things about the domain, about our strategy, and about the intended website. In this article, I’ll discuss these considerations and some strategies for success that can really help you to make a good, informed decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>To pick a domain name, you need to consider 7 things:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Has the domain been taken?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is the domain trademarked?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Domain Extension</strong></li>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Length of domain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Language and Spelling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Memorability</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>In the rest of this article, we’ll take a deep dive into each of these considerations regarding selecting your domain name. Let’s break it down in a way that makes sense:</p>
<h2><strong>*Has the Domain Been Taken?*</strong></h2>
<p>I think this one is obvious and self-explanatory. If someone already owns the domain, and they are not willing to sell it to you, then you will have no choice but to pick another domain name instead. With the internet being so important for the future of businesses, it is vital in my opinion, to choose a domain while one chooses a business name and gets a business license. This can really avoid a lot of headaches in the future.</p>
<h2><strong>*Is the Domain Trademarked?*</strong></h2>
<p>Like the domain being taken or not, this one is also a big deal. You don’t want to get mcdonalds.com if you don’t want to get a letter from the corporations’ lawyers telling you to cease and desist from using that domain (not that you could get that dot com domain anyway, but it makes the point). </p>
<p>You should do a search to make sure that you are stepping on anyone’s toes, legally that is. This can again avoid an issue down the road that could be devastating to your site if you have a subscription sort of service and/or reliant upon repeat customers visiting your site.</p>
<h2><strong>*Domain Extensions*</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s first talk about domain extensions. Most people who traverse the internet know that there are multiple different types of extensions when it comes to domain extensions that are, not hair. The most common domain extension is, of course, dot com, which everybody knows, for the most part. The next domain most people have heard about is dot net. Then you’ve also got similar extensions in terms of most people having familiarity with the extension. There are more regional domain extensions which are known well in particular regions or countries. For example: in countries like the United States the extension dot us is widely known, in Canada dot ca is known, you get the picture. </p>
<p>There are numerous new domain extensions as well like dot world and dot supply which are now in use as well. However, even with this being the case, the consensus of web developers and/or bloggers are currently of the opinion that you should try to stick to dot com. The reason for this is that currently, most people will remember dot com as the extension before they remember dot supply. For example, let’s say you have a website about 4 door cars, also known as sedans, and you chose sedanguide.info as your domain. Okay now if your regular readers happened to forget that the domain extension is dot info, in your case, albeit unluckily in this particular example, you have a dot info domain and more than likely, most of the time if someone has forgotten the extension, but they want to go on your website, maybe they’re on a different computer where there is no browsing history, and they want to go to your website and… The reader is going to start typing and if the reader forgets the domain extension, then usually what the result is going to be is dot com (at least that’s what most people in the western world think of first).</p>
<p>So ideally in terms of today’s internet culture, you should want to try to snag the dot com domain. Now the problem of course with trying to get the.com domain is 99.99% of all dot com domains have already been purchased at this point. It’s not the end of the world. If you don’t get a dot com, there’s always dot net which is a relatively accepted second domain, if you will but dot com is the ideal. But again you’re still going to be facing the same problem where people who don’t remember what you’re domain extension is they might very well go in and type into their browser sedanguide.com, now if you happen to have the domain sedanguide.net and one of your competitors has sedanguide.com then you’re going to be in trouble with this because if people forget your site they’re going to go to sedanguide.com and now they’ve just gone to your competitors website and you’ve lost traffic now potentially.  That’s not to say that you absolutely must get a dot com extension. </p>
<p>Domains as I said earlier, the majority of dot com have been taken, so that leaves me to believe that in the future dot com may very well, and likely will, become a thing of the past. Let’s say the internet is like a small town that’s turned into a giant worldwide, single giant-sized metropolis.  Yet it started as a small town with a single road running through it. The main strip, main drag, the main road or whatever you want to call it, everybody knows this kind of the main street through the small towns, right? The main sort of road that goes through downtown and everybody knows about it.  Okay so when you’ve got a city or a town that’s just starting off everybody who has a business, wants to get that business set up on the main drag, on the main strip, on the main road that goes through downtown.  </p>
<p>As the city has grown and now it’s not the only main road going through downtown anymore. All the spots along the main road where a business could set up have been taken. Sure, maybe the road continues out of town but now you’re talking about going out of town, right?  So, in that situation, I would have a business move to the next street over the dot net. Now when we look at domain extensions, dot com really stands on its own.  The only thing that is close to dot com is one of the new extensions which is dot co, which is a short form for the company.  </p>
<p>Now I didn’t even know this until the other day and I’m a web developer.  I didn’t know that. I mean it’s a relatively easy assumption to make, but when you see how many domain extensions are now in existence, it’s crazy to try to assume anything, right?  Dot co could be dot Colorado for all I know.  So, I don’t think the future of domains is anything you need to really worry about with regards to the extension being a dot com.  </p>
<p>There is a common belief in the standard concept right now in the current Internet world where people that forget the domain extension automatically assumed the common dot com extension.  It is the number one reason right now why you should and do sort of need to have a dot com. In five years, this may not be the case anymore as it will entirely depend upon how well people receive the new extensions.  Extensions for the future of the internet and the future of domains are good looking good and extensions like dot com are not done and dead just yet despite the plethora of new and in my opinion, exciting domain extensions now in use.  Let’s go back to the city is the internet analogy again for a second. So, we’ve got our business on the main street, right downtown. Well you know, that’s fantastic for those businesses that have their business on the main street downtown, they’re pretty much guaranteed to have some sort of traffic because they’re on that main strip. </p>
<p>But it doesn’t necessarily mean the sites are going to rank well because as time goes on and as Google and Bing and other search engines get smarter and get smarter logarithms using AI to rank websites as website content becomes more and more important in the world of searches and ranking websites using the Domain as a ranking factor will actually become less and less important over time.  Now, this is something that I have seen in the long-term in the last decade with my work on the internet.  I have seen that initially when websites first came out, when the internet was fresh and new and the dot com was basically the only extension you could get, the domain extension played a major role. But as time went on, the domain extension is gradually becoming less and less vital and is migrating towards relevant extensions to the topics. This, of course, reflects the internet’s trend to migrate toward a more content based ranking system where information is king. It leads us to the next consideration: Relevancy.</p>
<h2><strong>*Relevance*</strong></h2>
<p>Going back to our sedanguide.com example, you don’t want to have that domain if your website has to do with fans.  Why?  Because you are clearly stating in your domain name that it’s sedans which takes the focus of your website. In other words, the topic of your website is not fans, it is sedans. You’re also not going to want to have a site about dump trucks that are called sedanguide.com.  So, there is some weight behind the consideration of the relevance of the domain with regards to that domain name and how it reflects accurately the topic of your website. Now that being said you can always choose a different name than your topic if, for example, you have a business this is often the case. Take Amazon.com for example. It’s not as though the Amazon site has anything to do with the actual Amazon jungle, so relevance kind of gets tossed when it comes to businesses. This is the reason why businesses with names that are not directly related to the topic must focus on branding and brand marketing to forward their brand. If this is the case for you and you want people to remember how they got to your site, where it is, that your site is not on the main road but that it’s on one of the side streets, if you didn’t happen to luck out with one of the dot com domain names, then you need to make sure you focus on your brand marketing and have a solid brand marketing strategy. That really relates of course to SEO, check out the article on some basic <a href='https://farmsix.com/3-tips-to-seo'>SEO concepts here.</a></p>
<p>A lot of the marketing that you do on your website really affects how your website does in terms of rank and thus in terms of traffic.  If you’re smart about your marketing strategy, then you’ll include your actual web domain somewhere in your marketing for brand domain recognition.  So, let’s say you do want to make a site about dump trucks and so you’ve got yourself dumptruckguide.ca for example. Now that’s fine and dandy here in Canada, a lot of people in Canada are aware of the dot-ca extension, but maybe you want people in Mexico or Brazil to be able to read your articles and increase your web traffic.  They may not know about the dot-ca extension as it is not as relevant to their location. When you’re working on your marketing tactics and your marketing strategies for your website, you’re going to want to market your website as dumptrucks.ca.  If you do not include that in your marketing strategy, you’re potentially giving up some visitors to your site because they may think it’s a dot com by default. Now the real question is how much does this really affect your traffic?  I’ve seen some decent websites that have extensions that are not dot com extensions but that are dot ca or are dot co.  I believe I just saw one yesterday is dot ‘io’, there are all kinds of new extensions out as I’ve said. I’ve picked up a bunch of dot world domains myself because I believe that the future of the internet is global and I want my brands to span the planet, not just my region or country.  </p>
<p>If we look at the history of how civilization has always been directly related to the ability to transmit information across said civilization. The size of the civilization has always been directly related to the ability of information to travel and be passed around within that Civilization which makes sense because how could you rule a kingdom if it takes 3 months to send a message across it. </p>
<p>If indeed humans are moving towards a unified more Global World where you know how the current generation can have friends in multiple countries, chit chat over Skype, chit chat over the internet, you can talk to somebody on the other side of the planet in seconds compared to the months that might have taken several hundred years ago to travel from one side of the planet to the other to deliver a message.  Now you just get on the phone, now you just get on Skype, you just get on the internet, text or whatever with people literally across the planet in seconds.</p>
<p>Trends in communications tell me, and I honestly believe, that the dot com hype will absolutely pass.  I think that when you’re choosing your domain name it’s very important even still today, to make sure that domain name is somewhat relative to the topic of your website unless you are a business with a branding budget.  As I said, you don’t want to have a website called sedanguide.com and it’s all about dump trucks, that doesn’t make any sense.  It might be a guide and the domain name states ‘guide’, but it says sedans, it doesn’t state dump trucks.  You might instead think of the heavyhaulerguide.com website domain instead. It may not say dump trucks, but it is relative to the topic as dump trucks are in fact capable of hauling heavy loads, so the domain is relevant to the topic. Therefore, if a person can look at that domain name and it makes sense to them, that it is related to the topic in some way shape or form, then likely you have chosen a half-decent domain name. With the advent of extensions that now include a relevant term, I think the same rule applies.  Obviously, this is going to be the future of the internet.  In the future of domains and the future of the way that the Google and Bing search engines rank stuff will be the focus of relevance more and more. And that’s why eventually people will, I think, forgot about dot com. I honestly think dot com will go the way of the dinosaur.  I don’t think it’ll ever disappear completely, but I think maybe 10 years from now people will be like: ‘That’s only for like major corporations that started back in the past.’. We’re getting a bit off topic though so let’s wrap up relevance by stating that this will be one of the driving factors in the future and you should heavily weight relevancy in your search to choose a good domain.</p>
<h2><strong>*Length of Domain*</strong></h2>
<p>The length of the domain isn’t really going to be a big thought process to wrap your noodle around. The idea here is that you want to use the K.I.S. rule: Keep it simple. The simpler the domain to remember, the more likely people will remember it. Simple right? Let’s use an example. I have a media business named Farm 6 Media. I chose farm6.ca as my domain because it reflects a) my brand, b) the country I work in and from and c) it’s super short therefore easy to remember. This is much simpler to remember that farm6mediabusinesslocatedincanada.com isn’t it? Now I also picked up farm6media.com as a domain which is also relatively short and sweet but also now includes not only my full business name but also includes a hint of relevant information by including the word media. To review, the length of the domain is always best shorter than longer. Longer may be okay but then again one would need to think about extra marketing to compensate for length. I say K.I.S. this one.</p>
<h2><strong>*Language and Spelling*</strong>    </h2>
<p>The language you choose for your domain is important. Most of the western world speaks English, so naturally, if your target audience speaks English, then that is the language you should write your site in. There are numerous ways to have a site translated, typically browsers can offer translation to the audience but it’s good practice to incorporate multi-language capabilities right into your website. This practice is, of course, essential, in my opinion, when one is thinking about choosing your domain name. The spelling is also important. </p>
<p>What you need to consider is that the easier it is for people to remember your domain, the more likely they are to return to your site.  Now that’s not to say they’re going to return to your site if you have bad content or if you know you’re not being helpful on your website then of course nobody’s going to return to it. But let’s say we have a site called Bobsscuba.com. That domain is 9 letters plus the extension.  If you can have a nine-letter domain instead of Bobsscubainhamiltonontario.com then which are people going to remember better?  Which are they going to be less likely to make spelling mistakes with when typing into their web browser? Obviously the shorter the web domain address, the easier it is to remember. As well, you want to make sure that the spelling is on point.  I have seen websites, that in order to get the name they misspelled something on purpose because they couldn’t get the correct spelling due to someone else already owning the domain.  That can be an absolute catastrophe.  </p>
<p>Let’s say that your business is about yoga with the name Upbeat Yoga, but somebody else got upbeatyoga.com. But you already went and bought your business license a couple of years ago, but you never had a website.  In this situation, I would consider going with ‘upbeat.yoga’ as this is even more relevant to your business than it would be if you had the dot com extension, even though the dot com extension is currently the ‘thing to have’. In 5 years, dot yoga might work better way with regards to SEO and you can rest easy knowing the spelling is exact to your business name.  I recommend you pick a domain that is spelled correctly in the language that your audience is primarily using.</p>
<h2><strong>*Memorability*</strong></h2>
<p>Last but certainly not least, we want to consider the memorability of the domain we are choosing. If a person can’t remember your domain, then you lose repeat business. Memorability really has a lot to do with the topic, spelling, and length of the domain as well as the extension. I think that some of the new extensions will work better for people to remember that a non-descriptive domain extension like dot com or dot net. What do those say other than they are dinosaurs of the internet? All those extensions tell me is that there is a presence on the internet. However, a descriptive domain extension like dot expert or dot review or dot music really directs me towards the topic, being perhaps more descriptive of the topic of the website and thus I will be able to remember better through association, or that’s the idea anyway. When you are deciding upon a domain name, keep memorability in mind.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>To review, first, you want to make sure the domain you want hasn’t been taken or trademarked. Next, you want to consider the domain name extension you will choose as well as the domain name length, what language it will be in and of course the spelling. Remember, the domain is your digital address short form business card directing people to you in one preferably short and sweet word or words.
