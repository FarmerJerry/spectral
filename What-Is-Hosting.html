<h1>What is Hosting?</h1>
<p>Trying To Figure Out Hosing Without Help Can Be Tough</p>
<p><strong>Web hosting is the process of storing websites and serving them up to the internet.</strong> Back in the good old days, before the internet really took form, there were BBS or Bulletin Board Systems. These were basically a computer set up to act as a server and people had to ‘dial in’ to the BBS through the phone line. This was obviously before we had dedicated internet/cable lines running around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We used to use cassette tapes to play video games. Yeah, that was the ‘good old days’. Now we go online and get an entire website in seconds that would have taken hours to download using the old BBS systems. Hosting is like the new BBS for websites. It is the process of taking a website and serving it to users’ computer browsers to accommodate visiting the site and interacting with it.</p>
<h1>Why Do I Need Hosting?</h1>
<p>Unless you have a dedicated server setup at your home or business, you will need hosting. Without hosting, your website will not exist. Think of building a website like building a house. The property is your domain name. This is the address where your ‘house’ is built. The hosting is like the foundation of the house. It holds the website up for the world to see. Without the foundation, the walls would collapse and there would be nothing to see at the domain address. So if you want to have a successful website, you MUST have it hosted on the internet somewhere. Without hosting, you will not have a website so it is essential.</p>
<h1>Can I Host My Own Website?</h1>
<p>You can choose to either host your own website, or trust a reliable hosting service, like Bluehost, so host your website. Although it is a great idea to get the experience of setting up your own server and hosting your own site, I don’t recommend it except for the experience. There are multiple reasons why I recommend using a trusted hosting provider.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>. You can pretty much guarantee that a hosting company can serve up your website faster to the world than your home setup server can. Because hosting companies do this for a living, they are professional and have solid, stable servers. Because the servers used by a hosting company are professional-grade, they typically work much faster than a server you set up at home. They also have ISPs that provide a commercial internet account to the hosting companies that allow for much greater and faster traffic flow inbound and outbound, that your home provided ISP service will allow. Some internet providers won’t let you host a website at your residence if the traffic will be beyond a trickle. You would have to check with your ISP first.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>. Again, the hosting company is using professional-grade servers. Most hosting companies also include redundancy and even offer backup services for your website. This ensures that if there is a power outage or a glitch in the programming, your site suffers a minimum amount of downtime. If you have a server setup at home and there is a problem while you’re off at work or shopping or something, unless you have an IT person on staff, your site will remain down until you get home to fix it. When you use a reliable hosting company, you may not even know your site went down while you were out because often times it’s fixed right away by the hosting company. That is if the hosting company’s redundancy fails which is typically unlikely. That all in mind, reliability is paramount when it’s your income on the line.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Volume</strong>. Hosting companies are typically set up to handle the volume. That is the goal of your site, to grow right? Well imagine having a site set up at home on a home server and it crashes because either your internet connection from your ISP can’t handle the bandwidth or the server itself can’t handle it. It would be a huge shame to miss out on income because your setup can’t handle the traffic.</li>

</ol>
<h1>How Much Does Hosting Cost?</h1>
<p>Web Hosting Doesn’t Have To Cost An Arm And A Leg!</p>
<p>Hosting is not an over expense service until you get into very large volumes of traffic. You can actually get really decent hosting for a few dollars a month. Here in Canada, we can get hosting from $5.22/month as of August 10th, 2019. Now that’s $5.22 CDN. American that would be $3.94 USD/month. Ridiculously cheap for hosting that, in my opinion, can handle up to about 100k monthly before you need to consider upgrading. So if you are monetizing your website and are making $500+ per month, you only need to pay $5 to host it? Ridiculously cheap and Bluehost has incredible, stellar service to boot.</p>
<p>The service provided by my favorite hosting company Bluehost is worth quite a bit more than they charge, in my opinion. But what do I know? I simply build and run multiple websites for myself, my businesses and my clients’ businesses as well. Does that make me an authority? I don’t know but I do know that my clients, as well as myself, get fantastic service and even better price comparatively, from Bluehost.</p>
<h1>Who Is The Best Hosting Company?</h1>
<p>Which Web Hosting Is Best?</p>
<h3>For Under 100k Visitors Per Month</h3>
<p><a href='https://www.bluehost.com/track/farm6media/'>Bluehost</a>. Without a doubt. Stellar service from these folks. I use them myself on my new sites.</p>
<h3>For 100k – 500k Visitors Per Month</h3>
<p>I am currently reviewing the hosting companies whom I believe might offer decent service for larger volume websites. I’ll let you know when I’ve made a final decision based upon the analysis of the services provided.</p>
<h2>Examples of Bluehost Hosting For Small – Large Websites</h2>
<p>Here are some examples, all these sites are on <a href='https://www.bluehost.com/track/farm6media/'>Bluehost</a>:</p>
<p><a href='https://doghousetimes.com/'>Dog House Times Dog Magazine</a></p>
<p><a href='https://game.supply/'>Game Supply Video Game Reviews</a></p>
<p><a href='https://parilyz.com/'>Parilyz Music</a></p>
<p>These are all sites I have built. I have been using Bluehost for several years and have had a few occasions when I’ve had to call them for support. These have ALL been due to me mucking around with something and screwing something up. I have never actually had a technical problem with my hosting services that was not my own fault. Not once. I don’t think the service has gone down in the time I’ve been with <a href='https://www.bluehost.com/track/farm6media/'>Bluehost</a>. Seriously. No bull. You can call me and ask me for yourself. (647) 932-7594. Seriously. I don’t just support Bluehost because I signed up for their affiliate program. I support them because I like how they do business. And considering their services are awesome and cheap, it makes it ridiculously easy for me to tell you about them. Why? Because I’ve been using their services for years and I’ve never had an issue. </p>
<h1>Site Speed</h1>
<p>Take a look at how fast these sites respond. Ridiculously fast. Great quality website hosting. But Bluehost doesn’t have only hosting, they also offer domains as well. So it’s cool because you can snag your domain of choice from them, then build your site and have them host it. Neatly put together all in one place.</p>
<h2>Website Management</h2>
<p>The other thing I really like about Bluehost is the simple to use management. I can manage my domains, my websites and all my WordPress themes and plugins, both easily and conveniently. It takes mere seconds for me to access my WordPress admin panel on my sites so I can do maintenance, upload pictures or videos, whatever.</p>
<p>Content Management Matters. Really, it truly does matter. Bluehost specializes in WordPress which makes managing your site, sites and content super easy. Using a content management system like WordPress is perfect for bloggers, small business and more. </p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>And as our society moves more and more into a digital age, it is more important than ever that you can reach your target audience. Doing that with Bluehost, using WordPress is super easy to learn and works like a charm. Welcome to a better way of making websites. <a href='https://www.bluehost.com/track/farm6media/'>Choose Bluehost</a>.</p>
