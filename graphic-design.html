<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Fill in an order request form.</li>
   <li>Receive invoice from Farm 6 Media via Paypal and provide further information on project.</li>
   <li>You pay the invoice and we set our team to task.</li>
   <li>Receive updates on your project completion.</li>
   <li>Receive product draft copy for approval.</li>
   <li>Receive final product and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Further Details</h3>
<h4>1. Order Request</h4>
<p>The first step is to place your initial order via our convenient form.  Please provide as much information as possible.  The more information you provide, the closer the result will be to what you imagine.  For our infographic packages, our team of marketing experts will come up with a winning content design for you.  If you have something in particular in mind, take a look at our custom design service.</p>
<h4>2. Recieve Invoice</h4>
<p>Once you've placed your initial request, we will review your request and send an invoice via Paypal.  We might also have some questions for you about your project and will definitely want to ask.  We want to make sure that what we provide is exceptional and the more information we can get about your ideal project result, the better we can understand how to make it amazing, just for you!</p>
<h4>3. Release Payment</h4>
<p>Now that we've got what we need to get your project off the ground, it's time to commit.  We ask that you pay the invoice as soon as possible so we can get started.  We do not start a project without payment so make sure you get your invoice paid right away so we can get started.</p>
<h4>4. Receive Updates</h4>
<p>Once we have confirmed payment, we'll let you know right away that we've started on your project.  We'll also keep you posted about how the project is coming along.  If our designers have any questions along the way, they might reach out with a partial draft or a question to help us make an exceptional graphic just for you.</p>
<h4>5. Receive Draft</h4>
<p>Our designers work hard and fast to get you the results you want and need.  At this stage in the project, we've designed something awesome and want you to see it.  Most clients are ecstatic when they get their draft, but sometimes there might be something you want altered.  Maybe you want a different font, or you've changed your mind about a color.  Whatever it is, let us know so we can adjust the draft to meet your specifications.</p>
<h4>6. Receive Final Product</h4>
<p>Now that we've got your project done, we'll send you the final graphic.  Usually we like to send this as a PNG image so you can use in high definition or you can 'dummy down' the image for faster loading time.  Either way, we provide you with a high quality image that you can use any way you like.  You own it, the graphic is yours to do with as you see fit once we have released the final draft.</p>

<h2>A Note On Refunds</h2>
<p>Once you have paid the invoice and we've started on a project, we cannot offer a refund.  Why?  Because our team needs to put food on their table too and if we commit labor to a project, we can't give our team their time back if you change your mind.  You are paying for our time.  Unless you know how to return lost time to our team, we cannot offer to return payment.  If you do figure out how to return time, please let us know immediately as we would love to go into business with anyone who figures that out.</p>
